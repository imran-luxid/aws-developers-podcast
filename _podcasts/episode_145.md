title:  "Retro coding - Commodore 64 and Amazon Q for developers"
description: "Ever dreamed of stepping back in time to the golden age of personal computing? In this episode of the AWS Developers Podcast, we journey back to the 1980s with Ricardo Sueiras, where we explore the iconic Commodore 64. Discover the challenges and triumphs of programming on this legendary machine, from the limitations of hardware to the vibrant community that formed around it. We'll delve into the unique sound capabilities of the C64, explore how modern tools like Amazon Q Developer can assist with retro programming, and learn how to tackle the challenges of converting basic programs to assembly language.

This isn't just a nostalgic trip down memory lane. Join us as we discuss how the experiences of early programmers, with their deep understanding of hardware and reliance on community support, continue to shape modern software development. Learn how generative AI tools like Amazon Q can enhance your coding experience, whether you're working on a retro project or building the next big thing. Prepare to be inspired by the ingenuity of early programmers and discover how the past can inform the future of software development."
